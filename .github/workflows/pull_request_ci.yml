# a) It is a commit on a pull request on a branch to be merged into master

      # The next steps steps do the following:
      #  
      # 1) Give the program "tar" root permissions
      # 2) Retrieve cached files associated with the protobuf-c library, if they exist
      # 3) Take away root permission from the "tar" program
      #
      # We need to do this because the Cache Action uses "tar" to restore cached files
      # into the runner. However, the cached files need root permission to get restored.
      # Thus, we need to give tar root permissions to do the cache restoration, then 
      # take it away once we're done (since if the caching step fails and we do the
      # insallation of protobuf-c with root permissions, we will get permission errors)
