# PiE Runtime [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pioneers/runtime.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pioneers/runtime)

Welcome to the PiE Runtime repo! This README will only cover how to install, build, and run Runtime. If you want to learn more info about how Runtime works, or are a new member, please check out our wiki https://github.com/pioneers/runtime/wiki.

This is a diagram of the entirety of Runtime. To download and view in detail, see `docs/Runtime-Diagram.png`:

## Overall Structure

Runtime can be divided into a few neatly containerized parts:

* **The Network Handler**: abbreviated `net_handler`, this is a process in Runtime, and is responsible for all communication between the Raspberry Pi and Dawn, and between the Raspberry Pi and Shepherd.
* **The Device Handler**: abbreviated `dev_handler`, this is a process in Runtime, and is responsible for all communication between the Raspberry Pi and all the devices that are attached to the robot at any given time.
* **The Executor**: this is a process in Runtime, and is responsible for running the student code that is uploaded to the robot from Dawn.
* **The Shared Memory Wrappers**: abbreviated `shm_wrapper`, this is the tool that facilitates the efficient communication between the above three processes. Think of this wrapper as the "glue" that holds the three processes together, and lets them talk to each other.
* **The Logger**: this is the tool that Runtime uses to gather all the logs generated at various places in the code (including by student code) and outputs them to a terminal window, to a file, to Dawn over the network, or to some combination of the three.
* **The Device Code**: codenamed "`lowcar`" <sup id="return1">[1](#footnote1)</sup> this is the set of all the code on the Arduinos that directly control an individual device that is connected to the robot. All of this code is collectively called the "lowcar library".
* **The Systemd Services**: this is a collection of system services that allow Runtime to start automatically when the Raspberry Pi is turned on, recover when Runtime crashes, and automatically get and install new Runtime updates from this Github.
* **The Runtime Utility**: this is a collection of helper functions and defined constants that are used throughout Runtime. Most of them have to do with certain Runtime configuration values, maximum sizes for certain messages, or retrieving information about the different types of `lowcar` devices.
* **The Scripts**: this is a collection of shell scripts that do general things to all of Runtime, such as build it, run it, and test it. There is also a tool to flash `lowcar` devices. All of them are called by the `runtime` script in the root directory.
* **The Test Framework**: this is a collection of clients, command-line-interfaces, tools, visual aids, scripts, and test programs that we use to diagnose problems with Runtime as well as run automated tests of the entire system, without the need to use a real robot, or have a working version of Dawn or Shepherd.

In addition to these parts, there are a number of configuration files for Runtime to manage the various tools that we use. They are listed here, with a brief explanation about what they do:

* `.dockerignore`: this file lists out all of the directories, files, and other information that we do not want to include when building Runtime's Docker image.
* `.gitignore`: this file lists out all of the directories and files that we don't want in our Git repository. This includes things like executables, build files, and `.DS_Store`.
* `.gitattributes`: this file is purely for aesthetic purposes. It tells Github which files to exclude when calculating the repository language makeup you see in the repo (below the "Contributors" section in the sidebar on the web page that you're probably looking at right now).
* `.travis.yml`: this file tells Travis (the continuous integration tool that we use) what to run when checking if Runtime is working properly before a new feature is merged into the master branch. It is essentially responsible for running the integration tests and for updating Runtime's Docker image.
* `docker-compose.yml`: this file is used to describe to the `docker-compose` command what to run.
* `runtime`: this file is a convenience shell script that makes it easy to call the various other shell scripts in our directory, which you will read more about later.

This README will not go into each of these parts into exhaustive detail; explanations for each part can be found in the corresponding folder's README in the repo as well as [our wiki.](https://github.com/pioneers/runtime/wiki)

## Dependencies

Runtime is designed to be used on the Raspberry Pi, and with a distribution of Linux called Raspbian, a slight variant of the extremely popular Debian. We tested Runtime to work well on Linux systems. If you do not have a Linux system, please instead use Docker (which might even be easier than using Linux). The major benefit of using Docker is you can skip this entire dependency section. To learn more about it, check out the README in the `docker/` folder.

### Commonly Used Tools

As a baseline, Runtime uses the following commonly used tools that should already be installed on your machine (if you don't have these, ask the Runtime Project Manager to help you install them):

* Python 3.7 or later: While Python 3.6 will work, we recommend using Python 3.7 as that's what the Raspberry Pis are using.
* `gcc`: short for "GNU C Compiler", we use this compiler to generate executables from C source code.

### Third-party Library Dependencies

Runtime has the following third-party library dependencies:

* `Cython`: this library is used by `executor` to implement the Student API in a way that is both callable from Runtime (which is written in C) and from student code (which is written in Python)
    * Read more [here](https://github.com/pioneers/runtime/wiki/Cython)
* Google `protobuf` and `protobuf-c`: Google `protobuf` is the library that we use to serialize our messages between Runtime and Shepherd, and Runtime and Dawn. 
	* Read more [here](https://github.com/pioneers/runtime/wiki/Protobufs)

#### Installing Cython

1. `sudo apt-get -y install python3-dev`       (get `<Python.h>`, `libpython3.7m.so`)
2. `sudo apt-get -y install python3-pip`       (get `pip`)
3. `python3 -m pip install Cython`             (get `Cython` using `pip`)

#### Installing Google Protobufs and `protobuf-c`

1. From `https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases`, download the latest `protobuf-cpp-<release>.tar.gz` and extract it (for help, click [here](#extract))
2. From `https://github.com/protobuf-c/protobuf-c/releases` download the latest `protobuf-c-<release>.tar.gz` and extract it (for help, click [here](#extract))
3. You may need to install some tools (`libtool`, `pkg-config`, `g++`). To install a tool you don't have, run `sudo apt-get -y install <tool-name>`, replace `<tool-name>` with what you want to install.

4. `cd` into the folder for `protobuf-cpp-<release>.tar.gz` and run:
	1. `./configure`
	2. `make` (this takes a long time)
	3. `sudo make install`
	4. `sudo ldconfig`
5. `cd` into the folder for `protobuf-c-<release>.tar.gz` and run:
	1. `./configure`
	2. `make`
	3. `sudo make install`
	4. `sudo ldconfig`
6. (optional) To view `protobuf-c` documentation:
	1. Install `doxygen`: `sudo apt-get -y install doxygen`
	2. Repeat steps 5.i and 5.ii from above in the `protobuf-c` directory, then do `make html`
	3. Then navigate to that directory in Explorer/Finder and open the `html/index.html` file by double clicking on it

#### To download and extract a `tar` file from the command line <a name="extract"> </a>
First, download the tar archive into your current working directory with 

	wget https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/download/<release>.tar.gz 

Then, extract the files with 

	tar -xzf protobuf-cpp-<release>.tar.gz

You might need to install `wget` and `tar` with `sudo apt-get -y install wget tar`.

### Installing ncurses for Shared Memory UI
The Shared Memory UI allows the user to have a real-time view of data flowing in and out of shared memory.
This is analogous to the "shm_cli" among dev_handler_cli, executor_cli, and net_handler_cli.
Note that the UI is used in development only as a debugging tool and should not be used in production.
The command below will install ncurses on Raspbian / Debian machines:

	sudo apt-get -y install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev

### Installing Clang Format
Clang Format is used to format code to comply with our  [code style](https://github.com/pioneers/runtime/wiki/Project-Conventions). Code that is not formatted with Clang cannot be merged into master. After installing, use the runtime script to format code. (See `runtime format`)
```
sudo apt-get -y install clang-format
```
## Runtime Script and Usage

We use the bash script `runtime` in this root directory as the entrypoint to our code. You can call it with `./runtime <args>` in this folder. However, you can also have it be callable from any directory by adding it to your `PATH` variable. This can be done automatically adding the following line to your `~/.bashrc` file:

```
export PATH="$PATH:<path to runtime folder>"
```

Then either close and reopen the terminal, or do `source ~/.bashrc`.

If you now type `runtime` it will list all the possible subcommands you can run. We currently have

* `build`: will build the code base
* `run`: will run Runtime like how it will on the Raspberry Pi robots
* `test`: will run our test suite
* `format`: will format your code to match our style
* `flash`: will flash an Arduino as a Lowcar device
* `clean`: will remove all artifacts generated when building or running Runtime
* `update`: waits for new `runtime.zip` to appear in `/tmp` and then will unzip it and reboot the robot

## Authors

The first version of `runtime` in C was written in the summer of 2020 (when we all had lots of time.... fuck covid and trump) nearly entirely by:

* Ben Liao
* Ashwin Vangipuram
* Vincent Le
* Daniel Molina
* James Shi

Some inspiration and design was drawn from previous iterations of Runtime and Lowcar, written mostly by:

* Doug Hutchings
* Yizhe Liu
* Jonathan Lee
* Brose Johnstone
* Sam Zhou
* Brandon Lee

## Footnotes

**<a id="footnote1">1</a>**: This name has an interesting origin. The code for the devices used to be in a completely separate PiE project called "Hibike" (pronounced HEE-bee-kay). Some members of Hibike who wrote much of the original Arduino code were avid fans of anime. So, they named the project Hibike after the anime "Hibike! Yufoniamu" (_Sound! Euphonium_). Later, some members who were not such avid fans of anime decided to pronounce "Hibike" as "HAI-bike", which sounds like the two English words "High Bike". Later still, when members decided to refactor the code to be more object-oriented, it was decided that a new name was needed for the project. Ben Liao coined the name "Low Car" as wordplay on "High Bike", and the name stuck. [↩](#return1)
