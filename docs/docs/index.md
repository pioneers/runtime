# Welcome to Student API Docs

The student API is the set of all functions that the students have available to them to communicate with the robot. Outlined in the glossary will be all relevant information to begin coding a Pioneers In Engineering (PiE) robot.

This glossary encapsulates all the information relevant to programming your robot. In these docs you will find a collection of pages encapsulating each part of programming a robot from uploading your first script to creating your first student code. You can also find information explaining how to use PiE specific objects including the `Robot`, `Keyboard`, and `Gamepad` classes. It serves as the starting point for anyone venturing into the world of PiE robotics, offering a solid foundation to explore and create within this field.
